# booklist
A platform for buying and selling textbooks on a college campus.

The goal for booklist is to create a simple, easy to use tool for college students to buy and sell textbooks. Using a marketplace like this will "cut out the middle man" on used textbook sales, saving students money.

This project consists of two pieces: the server and client applications. The server consists of PHP scripts which access and SQL database which stores all of the textbook advertisements. Currently, the client is an Android application which can read and post advertisements. In the future other clients (web, iOS) clients may be added.
